# Solution to first ERC721 starknet tutorial

For simplicity I have pulled a docker image from [devnet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet) and deployed the workshop contracts there along with the tutorial ERC721. This worked faster for me.

```
npm install 
```
```
docker-compose up 
```

```
npx hardhat starknet-compile
```

```
npx hardhat test
```
